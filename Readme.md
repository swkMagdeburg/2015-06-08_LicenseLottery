# License Lottery

This is a demo project for a talk about Clean Architecture
at the Softwerkskammer Magdeburg.


## Use Cases

#### Create a new Lottery
As a user I want to create a new lottery with a given name
so that I can handle more than one lotteries with this application.

#### List Lotteries
As a user I want to show all created lotteries
so I can select one to run or review it.

#### Add Participants to a Lottery
As a user I want to add participants from a list to a selected lottery
so that I can start the lottery when all participants are added.
If a user doesn't exist in the list I want to be able to add a new one.

#### Run a Lottery
As a user I want to run a round based lottery
so that I can find a winner.
