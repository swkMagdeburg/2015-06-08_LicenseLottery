## Use Cases

#### Create a new Lottery
As a user i want to create a new Lottery with a given name,
so that i can handle more than one Lottery with this application.

#### List Lotteries
As a user i want to show all created Lotteries,
so that i can select one to run or review it.

#### Add Participants to a Lottery
As a user i want to add Participants from a list to a selected Lottery, 
so that i can start it when there are enough Participants added.
If a user does not exists in the list, then i want to be able to add a new one.
